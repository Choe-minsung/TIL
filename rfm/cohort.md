### Why Cohort?
- It widely used for mobile applications/games. Let's say we created a mobile game and published it. How do we know the game will be popular or die. It depends on the relationship with the users.  If the entrepreneurs analyze relations with the users, fix bugs and errors and take the necessary steps to organize their relations, they will at least increase their chance of survival.
- The most valuable feature of cohort analysis is that it helps companies answer some of the targeted questions by examining the relevant data. Cohort Analysis helps to understand how the behaviour of users can affect the business in terms of acquisition and retention and to analyze the customer churn rate.
