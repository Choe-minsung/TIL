RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing and has received particular attention in retail and professional services industries

RFM stands for the three dimensions:

1. **Recency(최근에)** : How recently did the customer purchase?
2. **Frequency(얼마나 자주)** : How often do they purchase?
3. **Monetary Value(얼마나 많이)** : How much do they spend?


### Classification criteria

Before starting RFM analysis we need to set objective and outcome of analysis, for this example goal is to define class of customer example - Platinum, Gold and Silver.

1. Platinum customer - frequent and more revenue generator.
2. Gold customer - frequent but less revenue generator.
3. silver customer - less frequent and less revenue generator.
